# Lab 1 – Exploring Data in Python 
Before beginning any prediction or learning task it is important to explore the data and familiarize yourself with the context, structure,  and characteristics. Fundamental descriptive statistics and graphical devices are helpful in this exploratory phase. 

The data set we will explore in this lab contains many examples and features of wholesale cosmetic sales from a manufacturer. We  may ultimately be interested in predicting sales amount based on the values of the other features available.  

Use the “CosmeticSales” data set link from Blackboard to import it into Python. This file is in “comma separated variables” or csv format, which makes it easy to read into Python.  

Use Python to perform this analysis. Place all numerical output, graphs, and tables into a well-organized word document, providing commentary and interpretation. Your final result before submission should be in the form of a presentable report. Tip: Use ‘Courier  New’ font in your presented document. 

1. Let’s first learn about the structure of our data. 

   a. How many “examples” or observations do we have in our data set? What does each example represent?
   
   b. Would you say this data is “structured”? 
   
   c. List the features or variables along with their respective “type”, i.e., numeric, or categorical. 
   
2. Now, that we understand the basic structure of our data, let’s explore the features. Let’s start with the nominal features in our  data. 

   a. Create a frequency table for “salesperson.” Which salesperson had the most number of sales? 
   
   b. Create a relative frequency table for “dept.” 
   
   c. Make a bar chart for “month.” 
   
   d. Make a pie chart for “location.” 
   
3. Now, let’s explore numeric features in our data. 

   a. Create a histogram and boxplot for both “amount” and “units”. Comment on the distribution of these variables  separately. Talk about the distribution of values of each of these features. 

   b. Compute the mean, median, and standard deviation for both these features. 

4. Now, let’s look for some relationships among features in the data.  

   a. Which “salesperson” has the highest mean “amount”? Which salesperson has the lowest mean “amount”?

   b. Which “location” has the highest mean “amount”? 

   c. Which “month” has the highest variance in “amount”? 

   d. Make a scatterplot of “amount” versus “units”. What pattern do you notice? 

   e. Make a two-way table of “location” versus “dept”. Any interesting trend? 

5. Now let’s try three variables simultaneously. Think of a creative way to show the relationship between “amount”, “units”, and  “location” and try it.
