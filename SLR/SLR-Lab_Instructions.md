# Lab 2 – Prediction using Simple Linear Regression (SLR)  

As a real estate broker, you are interested in a quantitative, data-driven approach to setting rental prices so that you can effectively price and lease apartment units. To aid you in this endeavor you have acquired data on recently signed residential leases in your area, in the ‘rent.csv’ file on Blackboard. Your objective is to learn if there is a significant relationship/pattern between the size of an apartment and the rent charged. If there is a relationship/pattern, we want to realize that relationship, explicitly, in the form of an equation and use this to predict the rent of newly available apartments using their size.   

Use Python for the following and present all your answers/explanations/visualizations in a (plain) text document: 

1. Which feature is your target and what type of feature is it? What general family of methods have we learned to predict this type of feature? 
2. Construct a scatterplot of the data, placing the appropriate variables on the appropriate axes. Try to title the chart and the axes appropriately. Try to play with the plotting symbols and the colors as well. 
3. Calculate r , the Pearson’s correlation coefficient. Describe the direction and strength of the relationship. Does this agree with what you learned from your scatterplot? 
4. Report the values for b0 and for b1 (the coefficients for the SLR model) and then write the equation in Ŷ = b0 + b1X form. Don’t use y and x, instead use “Size” and “Rent” in the equation to show you understand what this means. 
5. Report R2 , the Coefficient of Determination, and interpret it. 
6. Use the regression model you learned from Q4 to predict the Rent for a (i) 950 ft2 and (ii) 1500 ft2 apartment.
7. Plot the least squares regression line on the original scatterplot you created in Q2, and make sure it is thick enough that it stands out from the points. Try changing the colors too.
